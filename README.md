# Application-Logger
FUD Keylogger proof of concept:

Reading processes name and window title, to get logs. It's possible to limit logging for some processes only: like Firefox, Chrome to log browser history. The log can be easily sent over mail or uploaded to FTP server with no Antivirus or Firewall alert.

It does not keylogg every pressed button, but it can detect open windows and their titles: Show me what you are seaching, and I will tell you who you are!
